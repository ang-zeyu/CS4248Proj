## Sections 4.1 - 4.4 of the report (Statistical Methods)

There are 2 types of data collection "scripts" here, which are further annotated in markdown cells in the notebook:
- "One-off": Runs one combination of parameters. Good for quick testing.
- "Combination": Runs multiple combinations of parameters. Good for overnight testing.

Other than that, simply make sure that `fulltrain.csv` and `balancedtest.csv` files from the dataset are in the same folder as this notebook. (or, you can edit the variables `FULL_TRAIN/TEST_PATH` down below)

## LR



## LSTM
